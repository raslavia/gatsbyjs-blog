The name "[Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia)" is a combination of the word "Malay" and the Latin-Greek suffix "-sia"/-σία which can be translated as "land of the Malays". 'Malay' is an exonym for Melayu, an Austronesian ethnic group and a nation native to the Maritime Southeast Asia. The origin of the word 'Melayu' is uncertain and subject to various theories. The native epic literature, the Malay Annals, associates the etymological origin of "Melayu" to Sungai Melayu ('Melayu river') in Sumatra. The term is thought to be derived from the Malay word melaju, a combination of the verbal prefix 'me' and the root word 'laju', meaning "to accelerate", used to describe the accelerating strong current of the river. Another theory claims its origin from the Tamil words "malai" and "ur" meaning "mountain" and "city, land", respectively. found in the 11th century's inscription of Brihadeeswarar Temple.
